# My own Emacs config based on Spacemacs

## External depdencies
- vim
- Exuberant ctags
- pdf-tools
- ag (the silver searcher), pt (the platinum searcher)

## Goodies
- hydra integration in dired

## Difference from stock Spacemacs
- ui:
  - use a mode line based on `vim-powerline`, instead of spaceline
  - a "solarized" dark/light theme based on `spacemacs-theme`
- bindings:
  - more "vimish" bindings like C-h/j/k/l for window navigation
- packages:
  - remove stock packages and configs of spacemacs-layouts (window-numbering, eyebrowse, persp-mode).
    I use a simpler and more customised workspace config based on my own fork of eyebrowse.
