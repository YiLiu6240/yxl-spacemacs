* Bindings

** general bindings
- Do not bind ~j/k~ to navigate visual lines. It sacrifize navigation speed.
- bind ~C-h/j/k/l~ to window movement.
- ~H/L~ to tab/eyebrowse navigation
- ~g~:
  - ~gm~ to go to mark
  - ~gH/L~ as ~^/$~
- ~q~:
  - disable default ~q~ behaviour, replaced by ~qM~
  - record macro ~@~ bound to ~qm~ (I am using UK keyboards)
  - ~qq~ as ~:q~
  - ~qQ~ as ~:qwa~
  - ~qw~ as ~:w~
  - ~qW~ as ~:wa~

** insert state bindings
- As long as compatiblity with vim allows, remap insert state bindings to emacs style bindings, like ~C-n/p/f/b/a/e~ for navigations and ~C-h~ for backspace.

** other bindings
- ~<SPC> i <SPC>~ inserts lines above and below the current line
- ~<SPC> i i~ inserts one space before current cursor
- ~<SPC> i a~ inserts one space after current cursor
